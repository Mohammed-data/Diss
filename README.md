# 🏠 UK Housing Affordability: A 20-Year Econometric Analysis

This project explores the determinants of housing affordability in the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2023. It formed the foundation of my undergraduate dissertation in Economics at De Montfort University. Using macroeconomic data and econometric methods in R, the project investigates both long-run and short-run dynamics of affordability, with a focus on key variables such as wages, house prices, interest rates, household debt, and housing completions.

## 📌 Why I Chose This Topic

As someone deeply interested in real-world economics and social policy, I was drawn to the growing disconnect between wages and house prices in the UK — a crisis affecting my generation directly. This project allowed me to bridge data analysis with policy relevance and apply econometrics to a problem that is both academically challenging and personally meaningful. I was able to address an issue we all have faced/will face at one point in our lives, hoping to make a real difference.

## 📊 Methodology Summary

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   Public datasets from the UK Office for National Statistics and Bank of England

2. **Stationarity Testing**  
   ADF tests to check for unit roots and determine variable transformations

3. **OLS Regression**  
   Used to estimate the long-run relationship between affordability and its drivers

4. **Time Series Structuring**  
   Created ts objects to identify trends, seasonality, and structural patterns

5. **Interpretation**  
   Results interpreted through the lens of policy debates on supply, credit access, and real incomes

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📉 **Wage growth has not kept pace with real house price increases**, contributing to a sustained affordability crisis
- 🏦 **Interest rates showed short-run volatility effects** but were not the strongest long-run predictor
- 💳 **Household debt levels closely track price rises**, suggesting a debt-fuelled demand pressure
- 🏗️ **Housing supply (completions) had weak long-run impact**, reflecting supply inelasticity in the UK market
